# Quark CMS

Quark is an unopinionated content management system that strips down the concept of a CMS to its most basic elements. It allows you to easily create custom websites without any of the clutter, bloat, or baggage that most popular CMSs come with.

Built in PHP, Quark stays close to the language instead of abstracting, which means you can create in the language you know instead of learning a ton of new methods and built-in functions. Simply setup your site and start creating pages.

**!!! This is a work in progress and is still VERY insecure. DO NOT HOST ON A LIVE SERVER. !!!**

## Getting started:

1. Navigate to /setup.php, fill in database credentials and click Initialize Site button.
1. Navigate to /create-post.php and create your first post.
1. Posts are shown at /display-posts.php

## To Do:

* Move core functions to classes
* Fix glaring security flaws
* Create easy setup page
* Don't use "posts", just use "page"
* Create login feature and restrict sensitive pages
* Style admin pages
* Create REST API
