# Super Easy Awesome CMS

seaCMS is an unopinionated content management system that allows you to easily create custom websites without any of the clutter, bloat, or other baggage that most popular CMSs come with.

Built in PHP, seaCMS and stays close to the language instead of abstracting, which means you can create in the language you know instead of learning a ton of new methods and built-in functions. Simply setup your site and start creating pages.

**!!! This is a work in progress and is still VERY insecure. DO NOT HOST ON A LIVE SERVER. !!!**

## To Do:

* Move core functions to classes
* Fix glaring security flaws
* Create easy setup page
* Don't use "posts", just use "page"
* Create login feature and restrict sensitive pages
* Style admin pages
* Create REST API
